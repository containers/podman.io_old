{{ author.display_name }} @baude has posted a new blog: "[Podman container {or} image exists](https://podman.io/blogs/2018/11/27/podman-exists.html)".  Brent highlights the new `podman image exists` and `podman container exists` commands that help scrunch down podman commands with filters and greps into one easy command.
