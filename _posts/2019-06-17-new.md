We've received a number of requests for a mailing list for Podman and we're happy to announce that one has just been created!  We've built a friendly community on IRC and GitHub and plan to continue that growth in this new mailing list.  The maintainers of the project are all members of the list and we're happy to take any and all questions there about Podman.  You can also just use the list as a way to track what's going on with Podman as release announcements and other important news will be posted there.

Get all the details on this [blog](https://podman.io/blogs/2019/06/17/mailinglist.html) post!
