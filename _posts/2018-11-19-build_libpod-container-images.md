# Build Podman RPMs with a container image

Libpod development is still very much active and on-going.  We often have folks who are looking
to test out the latest libpod and Podman for either new features or bug fixes.  We typically
build RPMs for distributions like Fedora on a release cadence, which used to be weekly but now
has slowed down as libpod has stabilized.  Building libpod from source is not difficult, but
sometimes the user's environment will not allow them to install all the packages needed; or
perhaps the user is intimidated by building from source; or perhaps the user would prefer
the RPM package because it will make the upgrade process easier down the road.

To solve this problem, I have created a series of container images for CentOS7, Fedora 28, and Fedora 29 that are capable of building a development Podman RPM and associated packages.

#### A bit about the images themselves
The image that can used to build the RPMs is called *quay.io/libpod/build_libpod*.  You simply
alter the tag to build for the various distributions.  The *latest* tag will build CentOS7
RPMs.  Two other tags exist: *fedora28* and *fedora29*.

### Create the temporary directory
Create a directory for where the RPMs will be volume mounted.  It **must** be */tmp/rpms*.
```
$ mkdir /tmp/rpms
```
### Build the RPMs
Building the RPMs is a simple Podman command that leverages the `container runlabel` function in Podman. Once the image is pulled by Podman, it will install the required packages for building the RPMs.  After the build is complete, the container will also test to make sure the RPMs install correctly.

```
$ sudo podman container runlabel -p run quay.io/libpod/build_libpod:fedora29

### Future
If folks like this, I'll consider adding the ability to pass in a specific git commit to build.
