Scott McCarty wrote "[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta: A new set of container tools](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-beta-new-set-container-tools)".  In the blog Scott introduces the new container tools in RHEL 8 Beta.  Spoiler Alert!  No Big Fat Daemons were harmed in the examples Scott provides! 

Herv√© Beraud wrote "[How to Hack on Podman](https://herve.beraud.io/containers/linux/podman/isolate/environment/2019/02/06/how-to-hack-on-podman.html), which walks you through contributing to the Podman project.  

Both are great reads to help build your container tools knowledge.
