(Robert Bohne)[https://twitter.com/RobertBohne] has a nice [post](https://www.opensourcerers.org/2020/11/16/container-images-multi-architecture-manifests-ids-digests-whats-behind/) on
[opensourcers.org](https://www.opensourcerers.org) which talks about the basics of containers, how digests and manifests come into play,
working with and creating  multi-architecture images and more!  It is a really nice discussion of all the pieces and parts of a container image for someone new to the technology right through 
people who are a lot more experienced, but might not know every nook and cranny.
