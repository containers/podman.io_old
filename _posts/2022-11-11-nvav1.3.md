# Netavark and Aardvark-dns v1.3.0 release

We have cut new releases of the network stack components for [netavark](https://github.com/containers/netavark/releases/tag/v1.3.0)
and [aardvark-dns](https://github.com/containers/aardvark-dns/releases/tag/v1.3.0). Both netavark and aardvark-dns
versions 1.3.0 were released. As the process works, the upstream releases will slowly work their way into
Linux distributions.

A basic summary of changes for both are as follows:

### v1.3.0 Netavark
* Housekeeping and code cleanup
* macvlan: remove tmp interface when name already used in netns
* Add support for route metrics
* netlink: return better error if ipv6 is disabled
* macvlan: fix name collision on hostns
* Ignore dns-enabled for macvlan (BZ2137320)
* better errors on teardown
* allow customer dns servers for containers
* do not set route for internal-only networks
* do not use ipv6 autoconf

### v1.3.0 Aardvark-dns
* allow one or more dns servers in the aardvark config
