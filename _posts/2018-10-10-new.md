Adrian Reber @adrianreber has posted a blog on how to "[Add checkpoint/restore support to podman](https://podman.io/blogs/2018/10/10/checkpoint-restore.html)".  By using checkpoint/restore, it is possible to resume a container after a reboot at exactly the same point in time as it was checkpointed.
