If you want to know how to use Podman v3.0 to convert Docker Compose YAML to a format that Podman recognizes, [Brent Baude](https://twitter.com/bbaude) explains the "how to" in a recent blog post on the [Red Hat Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/) site, [From Docker Compose to Kubernetes with Podman](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/compose-kubernetes-podman).  This functionality is now available in the upstream version of Podman if you want to take a sneak peak.
