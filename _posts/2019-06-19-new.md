Red Hat has recently posted an OnDemand course: [Container pipelines for sys admins—and anyone, really—with Buildah and Podman](https://www.redhat.com/en/events/webinar/container-pipelines-sys-admins-and-anyone-really-buildah-and-podman?sc_cid=701f2000000txokAAA&utm_source=bambu&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=abm). The session teaches you how to integrate both Podman and Buildah into your continuous delivery (CI/CD) solutions and also serves as a good introduction to both tools.  The cost can't be beat (free!), so if you're looking for a quick introduction into the tools, this is a good way to go.
