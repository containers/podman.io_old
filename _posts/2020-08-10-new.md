In the release of Podman 2.0, we removed the experimental tag from its recently
introduced RESTful service. While it might be interesting to interact with a
RESTful server using curl, using a set of Go based bindings is probably a more
direct route to a production ready application. More details from Lokesh
Mandvekar and Parker Van Roy in this
[post](https://podman.io/blogs/2020/08/10/podman-go-bindings.html).
