Do you want to know how to setup RHEL 8 to run containers using Podman? Xuegang Jin has a blog post on the [Red Hat Blog](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog) about this very subject,  [Working with Linux containers on RHEL 8 with Podman, image builder and web console](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/working-linux-containers-rhel-8-podman-image-builder-and-web-console).
