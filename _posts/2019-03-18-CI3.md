# CI, and CI, and CI, oh my! (then more CI)
## By {{ author.display_name }} [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ author.github }})

I wanted to write a detailed post about the CI setup we use for exercising proposed
changes to [libpod (podman repo)](https://github.com/containers/libpod).  Unfortunately
this topic (and automation in general)
is so big, most readers would end up on the floor, sound asleep, in a puddle of their
own drool.  Instead, I will keep your fidget-spinner twirling, by jumping around
several topics.

<!--readmore-->

Starting with an overview on why we chose to use [Cirrus CI](https://cirrus-ci.org/), I'll
provide a short 3-step
walk-through of how it works, along with lots of links.  Then, we'll go into more detail
regarding VM Image orchestration, before connecting that back to our Cirrus-CI
configuration.

### Why Cirrus-CI

I once said "testing code is at least 10x harder than writing it".  This is especially true when a
software-engineer believes their code is "perfectly good" (meaning, tons of bugs).  At the same
time, test automation is generally as reliable, as the inverse of its simplicity (especially when
it's never simple).  Which brings me back to around July/August of '18:

The libpod project was considered by many to be "perfectly good", but its  automation was definitely
not simple.  At least one part or another constantly [jacked-up](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jacked_up#English).
At the time, automation was split
across two totally different services, operating with incompatible yet duplicate configurations.
The third service is a downstream consumer of libpod, but at the time was also under consideration
to take over pull-request automation from the first two:

* Travis
  * With [Ubuntu Trusty only a few years old](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2014-April/000182.html),
    we ran tests on a platform version nobody was using,
    with bleeding edge-code jammed on top.  Some OS-X tests ran, and we think at least one person
    looked at the results, some of the time, every once in a while.
  * Required a contrived containerized-environment to workaround host-side limitations.  Fixes for
    fake environments almost never improve reality.  e.g. impossible to test or fix AppArmor or
    SELinux problems from inside a container.
  * The tests did not represent reality.  Most people would never run container tools within a
    container, and certain security tools like SELinux and AppArmor would not be tested running
    inside this environment.

* PAPR
  * An internal "maintenance mode" service, meaning only bug-fixes, no new features. Supported by a
    single, talented engineer, from another group, perfectly happy to be working on something else.  
  * Fortunately it does have great support for running things on Atomic Host, which we still use to
    maintain our insanity...I mean, double-check some things.
  * The underlying infrastructure is unpredictably reliable. Mainly due to frequent
    [dog-food poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).  

* OpenShift
  * An elegant, impressive piece of machinery, with tests so numerous that most other projects would
    have trouble calling up enough drool.
  * Fantastic at testing containers and at-scale orchestration.  However way too complex for our
    low-level, host-side poking of runtimes, and userspace.
  * Downstream from libpod by weeks or months depending on the platform, like RHEL for example.
  * Both Travis and PAPR already demonstrated the pain of testing host-side libraries/tools
    within a container, no further lessons or reruns required.

As if this vegetarian sausage wasn't already dripping with liquid goodness.  The smallest little
network blip, and you have to re-run the entire suite again.  The importance of network speed and
robustness can never be overstated.  So I set out on a mission against complexity, toward being
able to reliably and frequently ruin engineer's "perfectly good" code before it merges.

### GET OFF MY LAWWWWWN!

The Cirrus CI killer feature.  You can selfishly
[bring your own cloud](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/supported-computing-services/)
and everything else to make
it work, and not have to share with Billy Bob's Used tire and doughnut shop.  You're the master of
the entire host and runtime environment, OS, kernel, packages, updates, everything!  Then, with
[the Cirrus CI app](https://github.com/marketplace/cirrus-ci)
on your code repository, testing follows this simple automated sequence:

1. Create VMs (or containers) in your cloud, using your encrypted credentials.
2. Follow [instructions you've spelled out like B-A-S-H](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/writing-tasks/#script-instruction).
3. Show green on exit(0) - the "pretty" engineer's code is properly spoiled (i.e. functional).

So
[Cirrus CI gives all the power](https://cirrus-ci.org/#comparison-with-popular-ciaas)
for success, and/or blasting giant, perfectly round, holes in your own two feet!
Our CI experience can be as simple or complex as we like, and reliability will match that of major
cloud providers and the inverse of our cleverness. What could possibly go wrong? :D

### VM Image Orchestration

Implementing the bowels of any CI/Automation stack usually begins with orchestrate the initial
operating system state.  Therefor, for efficiency-sake, it's handy to cache this work before,
exercising project-code changes.  Otherwise, it's a complete waste of (expensive) engineer-time
to constantly install, update, and configure all aspects of the system during every test run.

As
[recommended by Cirrus CI](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/supported-computing-services/#custom-vm-images)
, we utilize a tool by the inventors of Vagrant: [Packer](https://www.packer.io/).  I was able to
make it do things in a matter of minutes, as packer is fairly brain-dead-simple.  It accepts a JSON
file, which I have simplified as YAML for readability.  A simple (non-functional) example will
demonstrate the basic ideas:

```yaml
---

variables:  # all up-front, no guessing allowed!
    foo: "bar" # simple
    build_image_suffix: "-libpod-{{env `COMMIT_SHA`}}"# from env. var

builders:  # Where to do stuff

    - type: "googlecompute"   # TONS of others supported too
      image_name: '{{build_name}}{{user `build_image_suffix`}}'
      # ... more details ...

    - type "googlecompute"
      # ...other OSes...

provisioners:  # How to do stuff

    - type: "shell"
      script: "/path/to/{{build_name}}_setup.sh"  # macro looks up OS

post-processors:  # Where to stick stuff
    - - type: 'googlecompute-export'
        paths: ... # name of storage bucket where VM Image will rest.
```

In English, the above translates to:

1. Using some provided variables like `foo`, but fill the variable `build_image_suffix`
   using the env. vars `$COMMIT_SHA`
2. Spin up some VMs in GCE.
3. Upload and execute a shell script on each VM (in parallel).
4. Assuming success, store the resulting VM image into a storage bucket for
   later use as needed, or will expire and get automatically deleted after a time.

Perhaps that's over-simplifying things a little, but
packer provides mostly [just the bear-necessities](https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/index.html)
(sorry, [song is stuck in my head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08NlhjpVFsU)). Roughly ten
minutes after running a simple packer build command, the VMs are automatically torn down, and their disks
saved.  At a time of our choosing, an image can be imported from the storage bucket,
then a small PR tossed up to activate the images for Cirrus.

### Packer &rarr; Cirrus-CI Connection

Next up the stack, we'll dig into some basic details of the Cirrus CI system.  If you've used
services like Travis before, this example .cirrus.yml file won't be too surprising (simplified
somewhat for example purposes):

```yaml
---

# Safely stored details about accessing our cloud
gcp_credentials: ENCRYPTED[blahblah]

env:  # environment and behavioral values for all tasks and scripts
    # Where to clone the source code into
    CIRRUS_WORKING_DIR: "/var/tmp/go/src/github.com/containers/libpod"
    SCRIPT_BASE: ./contrib/cirrus  # saves some typing (below)

testing_task:  # One particular set of things to do

    gce_instance:  # What kind of VM to use
        image_name:  # Same as image_name produced by packer (above)

    script:  # Step by step
        - $SCRIPT_BASE/setup_environment.sh   # does what it says
        - $SCRIPT_BASE/unit_test.sh           # this too
        - $SCRIPT_BASE/integration_test.sh    # and this
```

With [Cirrus CI "installed"](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/quick-start/)
on a GitHub repository, upon any pull
request change, Cirrus CI will step
in to kick things within GCE, then report back results in your pull request.

However, we also need to test more than one OS.  This is easily accomplished in Cirrus CI, by
using what they call a
[matrix modification](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/writing-tasks/#matrix-modification).
Roughly translated into simple country-folk speak as: "*we done messed up our YAML parser
to do more fancier things, and stuff*".  Illustrated in part by looking at an
excerpt from our
[actual .cirrus.yml file](https://github.com/containers/libpod/blob/master/.cirrus.yml)
in the libpod repository:

```yaml
...cut...

testing_task:

   gce_instance:
        image_project: "libpod-123456"
        zone: "us-central1-a"
        cpu: 2
        memory: "4Gb"
        disk: 200
        matrix:
            image_name: "ubuntu-18-libpod-a250386d" # <-- name from packer
            image_name: "fedora-28-libpod-a250386d"
            image_name: "fedora-29-libpod-a250386d"
...cut...
```

The above will automatically duplicate the `testing_task` three times, running a different VM image
for each.  You can run a matrix across other items as well, like environment variables.  There are
also options for filtering your matrix, and adding dependencies between tasks.  I'd spell those
our for you, but it's liable to suck the lubrication from your fidget-spinner.

### Good looks and clean presentation

Another Cirrus CI feature we utilize, has to do with the way
[the scripting](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/writing-tasks/#script-instruction) output is
presented.  This
includes what you don't see, like extraneous buttons and widgets.  The way details are  presented
can be critical for debugging.  Here's how we leverage that simplicity:

```yaml
testing_task:

    ...cut...

    setup_environment_script: $SCRIPT_BASE/setup_environment.sh

    unit_test_script: $SCRIPT_BASE/unit_test.sh
    integration_test_script: $SCRIPT_BASE/integration_test.sh

    ...cut...
```

It's possible to have multiple scripts or commands per \_script section.  Because we dedicate one
per, the output is presented in bite-size pieces:

![cirrus-ci example](/images/cirrus-ci-task.png)

This makes it super easy to find what you're looking for.  If the unit-tests fail with a complaint about
some invalid environment variable.  It's easier to drop down that box than to go scrolling through
a giant
[wall of text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wall_of_text)
(though that's sometimes necessary also).  On the other hand, if the output
was all jammed into a single \_script block, tracking down problems might get too challenging
for my old-fogy sensibilities.  Mind I've only celebrated my 38th birthday four times so far...and
remember exactly zero of what happened those nights.

### Conclusion

There are many other details I could get into, but sadly, my coffee mug is empty and I can see that I
forgot to wash it (again).  Nevertheless, if you need some simple nuts-and-bolts automation, I
highly recommend [Cirrus-CI](https://cirrus-ci.org).   It's (beer) free to use for open-source
projects.  The
[Google Cloud Engine](https://cloud.google.com)
is also pseudo-free for quite a while, since they give you a
very generous, and substantial startup credit.

Other than finding a new mug or my soap, if there are any burning questions here,
or snide remarks there, please feel free to find me in #podman on Freenode (IRC).
Unless the question is too-smart, I might even be able to answer it.  Until then,
may your pretty code keep its bugs well hidden *and* out of sight.
