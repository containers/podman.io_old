Ed Santiago (@edsantiago) needed help with his New York Times crossword puzzle.  So naturally he turned to Podman to save the day.  Read about it in his blog post: [Podman Saves My Crossword Habit](http://blog.edsantiago.com/2019/03/podman-saves-my-crossword/).  Many thanks to Ed for sharing this
innovative use of Podman.
