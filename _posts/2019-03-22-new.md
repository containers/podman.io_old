It's in German, but a worthy read [Podman: Linux containers made easy, part 1](https://www.heise.de/developer/artikel/Podman-Linux-Container-einfach-gemacht-Teil-1-4329067.html).  Valentin Rothberg (@vrothberg) introduces Podman to the reader and talks about how it fits in the container eco-system.  If your German is a little rusty, you may need to lean on [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&tab=TT&authuser=0).
