[Valentin Rothberg](https://twitter.com/vlntnrthbrg) just landed a blog post on the [Red Hat Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/) site [Improved systemd integration with Podman 2.0](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/improved-systemd-podman).  In the post, Valentin talks about how systemd in Podman v2.0 is even more tightly integrated than it was in prior versions.
