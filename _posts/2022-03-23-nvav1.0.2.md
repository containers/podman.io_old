# Netavark and Aardvark-dns v1.0.2 release

The Podman development team has released new versions of both
[Netavark](https://github.com/containers/netavark/releases/tag/v1.0.2) and
[Aardvark-dns](https://github.com/containers/aardvark-dns/releases/tag/v1.0.2).  The releases mostly consist of
updated dependency libraries and bugfixes.  Additionally, netavark is now capable of having a statically addressed
macvlan without a gateway address.  New packages for Fedora 36 and the
[Podman4 COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/rhcontainerbot/podman4/) are being built and should be
available shortly.
