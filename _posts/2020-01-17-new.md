The new API for Podman, referred to as *apiv2*, has been merged into the [libpod](https://github.com/containers/libpod/) repository.  It's a simpler REST API that's more compatible with Docker implementations than the [varlink](https://varlink.org/) protocol that's currently in use.  For more details, see this [release announcement](https://podman.io/releases/2020/01/17/podman-new-api.html) by {{ author.display_name }}.
