{{ author.display_name }} has another blog post on the [Red Hat Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/) site this time about [Rootless Podman and NFS](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/rootless-podman-nfs).  In the post Dan talks about how you can make some minor configuration changes to allow Podman to use a user's home directory on an NFS share.  Give it a read!
