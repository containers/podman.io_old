[Brent Baude](https://twitter.com/bbaude) explains the how to in a recent blog post on the [Red Hat Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/) site, [Podman: Managing pods and containers in a local container runtime](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/01/15/podman-managing-containers-pods/).
