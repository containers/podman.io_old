# Replacing Docker with Podman
## By Dan Walsh

At the "All Systems Go!" conference on September 28-30, 2018 in Berlin Germany, Dan Walsh gave a talk on how you can replace `docker` with `podman` and not skip a beat.  The talk was taped and can be viewed [here](https://media.ccc.de/v/ASG2018-177-replacing_docker_with_podman#t=3).

The slides in PDF format are [here](../slides/2018_10_01_Replacing_Docker_With_Podman.pdf).
