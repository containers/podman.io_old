[Ashley Cui](https://twitter.com/cuicodes) recently joined our team at Red Hat and just wrote her first ever blog post that is now on the [Red Hat Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/) site [Tick-tock. Does your container know what time it is?](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/tick-tock-container-time).  In this timely post, Ashley walks you through setting the timezone within a container using the `--tz` option.  Just prior to this posting, I had answered a very similar question for someone.  This is a really good and quick blog, and I'm sure the first of many for Ashley.
