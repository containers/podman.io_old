Scott McCarty (@fatherlinux) has an amazing video on YouTube about [Building freely distributed containers with open tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qcys7fKSzB0&t=84).  As only Scott could say "Although explaining how to ride a Tron-style light cycle is beyond the scope of this tutorial, we will discuss something almost as exhilarating—building containers with #Podman and #RedHat Universal Base Image (UBI). We will cover how to build and run #containers based on #UBI using just your regular user account—no daemon, no root (rootless), no fuss. Finally, we will order the deresolution of all of our containers with a really cool command. You probably won’t be promoted to CEO of ENCOM after this talk, but you will have new tools in your toolbelt for how to find, run, build, and share container images."
