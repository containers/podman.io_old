## Dockerless: Build and Run Containers with Podman and Systemd

## By {{ author.display_name }} [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ author.github }}) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ author.twitter }})

[In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfL_CjXfQds), Kirill Shirinkin will show how to use Podman to build container images and run Java applications in containers with Systemd.

We are going to learn why we should at least try alternatives to Docker, how container runtime landscape changed and how Podman is different and in certain ways better than Docker.

[Watch now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfL_CjXfQds).
