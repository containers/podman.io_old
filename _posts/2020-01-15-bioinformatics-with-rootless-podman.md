# Bioinformatics with rootless podman
## By {{ author.display_name }} [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ author.github }}) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ author.twitter }})

Over the last 10 years I've seen machines and workflows evolve where I work. From the initial dedicated server, to hpc environments 
and now the latest instance, containers.

From an admin point of view this is great - The initial servers had to be carefully built and maintained so that everything would work nicely together. Incompatible programs at that time were run through a VM until such time as they could be folded in to the mix.

The HPC's had versioned software and environment modules and were built to load the relevant dependencies at run time.

Now we are into a new era, containers - and not just any old containers, but containers that end users can build and run up fairly 
quickly to perform what-if's, and move on quickly through iterations until they perform the required functions.

Podman has developed very rapidly and is incredibly easy to use. You can use it in conjuction with quay.io or run it on a local machine.

I should add that Adrian Reber gave a [talk](https://youtu.be/TtHSNsbU24E) and has also created a Podman [article](https://podman.io/blogs/2019/09/26/podman-in-hpc.html) using openhpc; well worth a watch and a read.

If you don't have a RedHat Developer Subscription now is an ideal time to get one:

https://developers.redhat.com/articles/getting-red-hat-developer-subscription-what-rhel-users-need-know/

..and download RedHat Enterprise 8.1

<!--readmore-->

Do a Standard RedHat GUI Server default install

```
yum update
yum module install container-tools
```
RedHat 8.1 does rootless containers right out of the box. If you created a user during the setup, it'll have the details in /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid already.

Log in with your userID and you can start creating a container
```
podman pull ubi8/ubi
podman run --interactive --tty ubi8/ubi bash
```
The first command pulls down the ubi8 Universal Base Image, which is a great building block. The second command starts an interactive ubi8 image at a bash prompt. You can run any commands you like in this:
```
[nbh23@colombo ~]$ podman run --interactive --tty ubi8/ubi bash
[root@f471459c7619 /]# cat /etc/redhat-release
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.1 (Ootpa)
[root@f471459c7619 /]#

```
Notice how the prompt changed from nbh23@colombo to root@f471459c7619 - the f471459c7619 is the part to remember, we'll interact with that later on in this post. It's a random allocation, so your instance will be different.

The Podman help menu's are excellent, podman -h gives you a list of subcommands, which you can then also query:
```
[nbh23@colombo ~]$ podman -h

```
We can list out the images and containers as follows, which is handy if you lose track of where you are at.
```
[nbh23@colombo ~]$ podman image list
REPOSITORY                            TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi   latest   096cae65a207   5 weeks ago   239 MB
[nbh23@colombo ~]$ podman container list
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                       COMMAND  CREATED      STATUS          PORTS  NAMES
a1fc64bd8e47  registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest  bash     2 hours ago  Up 2 hours ago         zen_albattani
[nbh23@colombo ~]$
```
So we created a container to interact with, but how about creating a new image?
I found that Podman is very easy to interact with and created a Dockerfile. This is a list of commands in a text file that controls what gets installed.
Create a new directory - in this case whatshap, to put the Dockerfile in:
```
[nbh23@colombo whatshap]$ cat Dockerfile
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi
RUN yum -y update \
&& yum -y install python3 \
&& yum -y install make \
&& yum -y install gcc \
&& yum -y install redhat-rpm-config \
&& yum -y install zlib-devel \
&& yum -y install bzip2-devel \
&& yum -y install xz-devel \
&& yum -y install python3-devel \
&& yum clean all
RUN pip3 install pysam && pip3 install whatshap
```
Then we build the container image - from within the whatshap directory run:
```
podman build -t whatshap .
```
Notice the '.' at the end, that's important!

You'll see the container image start to build, with notifications of where it's at. If all goes to plan you will then finally see notification that it's completed:

```
STEP 4: COMMIT whatshap
d523727fc6c297086e84e7ec99f62e8f5e6d093d9decb1b58ee8a4205d46b3dd
```
We can then check it works:
```
[nbh23@colombo whatshap]$ podman run -it whatshap
[root@ac05564bd51b /]# whatshap -h
usage: whatshap [-h] [--version] [--debug]
                {phase,stats,compare,hapcut2vcf,unphase,haplotag,genotype} ...

positional arguments:
  {phase,stats,compare,hapcut2vcf,unphase,haplotag,genotype}
    phase               Phase variants in a VCF with the WhatsHap algorithm
    stats               Print phasing statistics of a single VCF file
    compare             Compare two or more phasings
    hapcut2vcf          Convert hapCUT output format to VCF
    unphase             Remove phasing information from a VCF file
    haplotag            Tag reads by haplotype
    genotype            Genotype variants

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  --debug               Print debug messages
[root@ac05564bd51b /]#
```
Which all looks good - we now have our container image and can re-run that to do our whatshap analysis.

All well and good, but what happens about storage of that analysis?

We can add that to our Podman command, if we have a directory called data in /home we can map that as follows:
```
podman run -v /home/nbh23/data:/home/nbh23:z -it whatshap
```
The nice thing is that the UID and GID for files created this way all match up. The trailing :z makes selinux happy :-)
```
[nbh23@colombo whatshap]$ podman run -v /home/nbh23/data:/home/nbh23:z -it whatshap
[root@fef561d523b8 /]# ls
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  lost+found  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var

```
One of the things I discovered whilst creating a more complex container image was that you can start the existing image into a bash session, doing the manipulation that you require, and then use the Podman commit command to write those changes.
For example using our whatshap container image we can run it as follows:
```
[nbh23@colombo data]$ podman run -it whatshap bash
[root@73c4742e4724 /]#
```
We can then make our alterations, and from another session commit those changes:
```
[nbh23@colombo ~]$ podman commit 73c4742e4724 whatshap-altered

```
Then do podman image list to see what we have:
```
[nbh23@colombo ~]$ podman image list
REPOSITORY                            TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE

```
You can make multiple changes to your original container image until you are satisfied that it's working as you'd like.

This has covered command line container image creation and usage, I'll be creating another blog post detailing graphical interactive containers as i'm aware that there are various interactive visual programs to cover too.

Feel free to contact me with any ideas or suggestions / questions.
