Podman version 1.7 is coming out soon and will include new features that will make management of containers with systemd services even easier. {{ author.display_name }} has a blog post on the [Red Hat Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/) site that previews the features: [Running containers with Podman and shareable systemd services](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-shareable-systemd-services).  In the post Valentin goes over the highlights and then gives a great working example.
