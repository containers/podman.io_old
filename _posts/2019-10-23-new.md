Ceri Williams talks about how the Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) can be run in a container using Podman without root privileges [here](https://www.percona.com/blog/2019/10/22/pmm-server-podman-running-a-container-without-root-privileges/?utm_campaign=2019%20Blog%20Q4&utm_content=103803368&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-35373186).  In the post Ceri talks about how Percona was able to replace Docker with Podman and Buildah and are able to run containers more securely by doing so.
