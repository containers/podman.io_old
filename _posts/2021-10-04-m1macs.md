The Podman development team is happy to announce that Podman machine is now supported
on Apple silicon hardware like the M1s.

<!--readmore-->
The initial versions of Podman machine only supported Intel-based Apple machines.  We could not support
the Apple M1s because we needed some changes to occur in upstream projects that we depend on.  Now that those
things are fixed, we support Apple silicon hardware with Podman 3.4.

In the last two weeks, we were able to clear the final hurdles to support Podman machine on Apple Silicon.  Many
thanks to the QEMU maintainers and the maintainers of brew.  And last but not least, the Fedora FCOS team
which officially supports the aarch64 architecture now.
