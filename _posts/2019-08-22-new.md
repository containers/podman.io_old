Scott McCarty has a blog post on the [Red Hat Blog](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog) about [Using the rootless containers Tech Preview in RHEL 8.0](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/using-rootless-containers-tech-preview-rhel-80).  Podman rootless containers has hit Tech Preview for RHEL 8.0 and Scott walks you through the setup necessary for rootless containers.  Small hint, it's a short post because it's just that easy.
