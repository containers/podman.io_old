**The local Podman v2 client is complete.  It is passing all of its rootfull and rootless system and integration tests.**

The CI/CID tests have been reenabled upstream and are run with each pull request submission.  We are now hard at work finishing up some of the core podman-remote functions.  Once those functions are complete, we can then begin to run our podman-remote system and integration tests to catch any regressions.

More details in the announcement [post](https://podman.io/blogs/2020/05/13/podman-v2-update.html).
