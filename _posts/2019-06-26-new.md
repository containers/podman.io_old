Ganesh Mani recently wrote the blog [Replacing Docker with Podman — Power of Podman — Cloudnweb](https://medium.com/@ganeshmani009/replacing-docker-with-podman-power-of-podman-cloudnweb-23cfb7541538).  The article gives a nice overview of Docker, Podman, their differences, and how you can use Podman to replace Docker.  A nice read and really, who doesn't love a blog that wraps up with a meme featuring The Rock?
