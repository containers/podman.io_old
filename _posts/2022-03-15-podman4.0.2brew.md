# Podman 4.0.2 is available in Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), also known as `brew`, now has the Podman v4.0.2 available. Updating should be trivial
but please make sure that Qemu is also upgraded alongside Podman. One cool feature that the community helped us
deliver is the ability to mount volumes from MacOS into the virtual machine.  We decided to backport some code to
make it available to users more quickly.  As such, it is possible if not likely that there will be more
changes around volume mounts in subsequent Podman releases (i.e. default mounts, technology used to make the mount).
