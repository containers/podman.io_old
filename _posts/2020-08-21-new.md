Do you want to know more about Rootless containers, process separation, and OpenSCAP?  If you're like many, a video is a better learning device than a blog post.  Well you're in luck, [Brian Smith](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/users/briasmit) just landed a blog post on the [Red Hat Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/) site [Container video series: Rootless containers, process separation, and OpenSCAP](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/container-video-series) with a number of blog posts on the subject, many featuring Podman.
