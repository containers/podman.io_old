Do you like you container names to be short, sweet and yet secure?  [Valentin Rothberg](https://twitter.com/vlntnrthbrg) shows you how in a recent blog post on the [Red Hat Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/) site, [Container image short names in Podman](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/container-image-short-names).  This functionality is now available in the upstream version of Podman and is targeted for Podman v3.0.
