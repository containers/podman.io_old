In a recent blog post on the [Red Hat Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/) site, [The podman play kube command now supports deployments](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-play-kube), you can now learn all about the recent features added to Podman to interact with Kubernetes objects.  The `podman generate kube` command allows you to export your existing containers into Kubernetes Pod YAML.  This YAML can then be imported into OpenShift or a Kubernetes cluster.  The `podman play kube` does the opposite, it allows you to take a Kubernetes YAML and run it in Podman.  Learn all of the details and more in the blog post!
