If you are looking into running Podman on Windows, Tom Sweeney's latest blog post on 
[EnableSysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/) shows you how easy it is now.  The
[Run Podman on Windows: How-to instructions](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/run-podman-windows)
runs you through the four steps that take five minutes to complete.  After that is done,
you can then run Podman from your favorite Windows terminal without first having to get into
a Virtual Machine.  As a bonus, there's a link to a walk through video tutorial included 
in the post.
