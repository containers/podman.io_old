We were just pointed to this post [Building Container Images with Podman and Buildah](https://blog.giantswarm.io/building-container-images-with-podman-and-buildah/) by Puja Abbassi on the [Giant Swarm]([200~https://blog.giantswarm.io/) site. In the article Puja goes over how Podman and Buildah handle daemonless and rootless building processes.  A tardy link on this site, but worth a read!
