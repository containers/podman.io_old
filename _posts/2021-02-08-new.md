[Tent](https://github.com/fhsinchy/tent/) is an open-source CLI tool for running development dependencies such as MySQL, Mongo, ElasticSearch etc inside pre-configured containers using simple one-liners. Developed using [Go](https://go.dev) and the official [golang bindings](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/containers/podman/v2@v2.2.1/pkg/bindings), `tent` is fast, reliable and secure.
