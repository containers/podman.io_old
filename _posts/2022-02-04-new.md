The recent Podman v4.0 RC4 release containers the new network stack.  Brent has just posted a new blog post: [Testing Podman 4 with new network stack](https://podman.io/blogs/2022/02/04/network-usage.html), to help you speed up your testing of the new stack.  If you find any issues, please note them on the Podman [issues](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues) on GitHub.
