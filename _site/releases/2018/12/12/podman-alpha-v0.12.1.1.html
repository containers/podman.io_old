<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
<p>This release comes with many exciting new features. To highlight a few of our biggest changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">podman generate kube</code> command was added by Brent Baude, which generates Kubernetes pod and service YAML from Podman containers and pods.</li>
  <li>Initial support for named volumes using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">podman volume</code> set of commands was landed by Urvashi Mohnani</li>
  <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">podman rm</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">podman rmi</code> commands can now prune unused containers and images with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--prune</code> flag</li>
  <li>Ports can now be published to the host from pods</li>
</ul>

<p>Numerous bugs were fixed as well, including a breaking change in rootless Podman found in 0.11.x releases.</p>

<p>To see the full changelog, please visit our release notes on <a href="https://github.com/containers/libpod/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md">GitHub</a></p>

<p>Some of this work, like the <code class="highlighter-rouge">podman volume</code> command, is still very early. We’d greatly appreciate feedback! If you have an enhancement request or a bug report, please file them on our <a href="https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues">issue page</a>.</p>
