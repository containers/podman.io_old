<h3 id="misc">Misc</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Podman migrated to a new, shared memory locking model in this release. As part of this, if you are running Podman with pods or dependency containers (e.g. –net=container:), you should run the podman system renumber command to migrate your containers to the new model - please reference the podman-system-renumber(1) man page for further details</li>
  <li>Podman migrated to a new command-line parsing library, and the output format of help and usage text has somewhat changed as a result</li>
  <li>Updated Buildah to v1.7, picking up a number of bugfixes</li>
  <li>Updated containers/image library to v1.5, picking up a number of bugfixes and performance improvements to pushing images</li>
  <li>Updated containers/storage library to v1.10, picking up a number of bugfixes</li>
  <li>Work on the remote Podman client for interacting with Podman remotely over Varlink is progressing steadily, and many image and pod commands are supported</li>
  <li>Added path masking to mounts with the :z and :Z options, preventing users from accidentally performing an SELinux relabel of their entire home directory</li>
  <li>The podman container runlabel command will not pull an image if it does not contain the requested label</li>
  <li>Many commands’ usage information now includes examples</li>
  <li>podman rm can now delete containers in containers/storage, which can be used to resolve some situations where Podman fails to remove a container</li>
  <li>The podman search command now searches multiple registries in parallel for improved performance</li>
  <li>The podman build command now defaults –pull-always to true</li>
  <li>Containers which share a network namespace (for example, when in a pod) will now share /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf between all containers in the pod, causing changes in one container to propogate to all containers sharing their networks</li>
  <li>The podman rm and podman rmi commands now return 1 (instead of 127) when all specified container or images are missing</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, please visit our release notes on <a href="https://github.com/containers/libpod/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md">GitHub</a> to see the full changelog.</p>
