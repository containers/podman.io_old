<h2 id="podman-has-gone-10">Podman has gone 1.0!</h2>

<p>Our original goal with Podman was to provide a fully-featured debugging experience for <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-o">CRI-O</a>, but it has become so much more. Podman 1.0.0 is a fully-featured container engine.  It provides a Docker-compatible command line to ease the transition from other container engines. Most Podman commands can be run as a regular user, without requiring additional privileges. Furthermore, all of this is accomplished without a daemon!</p>

<p>We’re happy to announce the availability of Podman 0.12.1.1, our latest version. We’ve been very busy over the last month, and it shows! We’ve merged over 150 new commits since our 0.11 releases, including major new functionality and several critical bugfixes. Pods, Kubernetes compatability, and container volumes all saw major improvements.</p>

<p>We hope everyone enjoys the release, and stays with us in the future as Podman gets closer to 1.0. As always, many thanks to everyone who contributed to this release!</p>

<p>Our release this week was very smooth. It seems like between CI infrastructure stability, last minute pull requests, and sometimes just plain bad luck, something always gives us trouble on Friday’s. The Fedora packages are created and I see that they are getting their karma and working through the process already.</p>

<p>By the way, we moved! Our new upstream location is <a href="https://github.com/containers/libpod">https://github.com/containers/libpod</a>. It seems to be a more natural fit for our project and more closely associates us with some of our sister projects.</p>

<p>Our latest podman release turned out to be a lot of internal plumbing. We had more than 50 commits but most were tweaks that most users would not notice. So I don’t have a singular, hot feature to point you at.</p>

<p>As most weeks are, this was fast and furious. You will see hand fulls of significant features below that have been added to podman this week. All of it is awesome work from the core team and its contributors. There were also two interesting features that users will be interested in: the ability to create a container with multiple networks and the podman remote client.</p>

<p>Last week was a busy holiday week here in the United States, but we still managed a nice release full of interesting merges.</p>

<p>Many of the significant merges are going to be less than noticeable to users. A lot of updated vendor code was added as well as the removal of unused functions due to cgroups and platform changes.</p>

<h1 id="podman-release-064">Podman release 0.6.4</h1>
<p>This afternoon we were able to overcome some last minute bugs and release a new Podman. The packages are building in Fedora and will work their way through Fedora’s bodhi system. For giggles, I looked at the number of individual contributors this week and was glad to see the number at 10.</p>

<p>Mainly bugfixes this week, one big one was that we do a better job cleaning up containers that run in the back ground.</p>

<h1 id="podman-release-061">Podman release 0.6.1</h1>

<p>It seems that when we have a short work week here in the US, we have rather large releases. To me, that flies in the face of logic. Speaking of which, one particular milestone was reached this week …
We had our 1000th commit in Podman!</p>

<p>That is particularly special, because prior to this repository, all libpod work was being done within the CRI-O repository. So the 1000 commits is in actuality since we broke apart from CRI-O. I want to recognize all the contributors who have been helping us along way. Great job!
##Other notable items in the release:</p>
