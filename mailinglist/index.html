A mailing list is now available for your questions, concerns or comments about Podman.  There are two methods that can be used
to subscribe to it.

<ol>
  <li>Send an email to <a href="mailto: podman-join@lists.podman.io?subject=subscribe">podman-join@lists.podman.io</a> with the word "Subscribe" in the subject.</li>
  <li>Go to the <a href="https://lists.podman.io">https://lists.podman.io</a> site and click on the "Subscription" button.  Scroll down on the next page and enter your email and optionally name, then click on the "Subscribe" buton.</li>
</ol>

Regardless of which method you use, a confirmation email will be sent to you.  After you reply back to that confirmation email, you'll then be able to send mail directly to <a href="mailto: podman@lists.podman.io">podman@lists.podman.io</a>

Please note, if you have a bug that you'd like to report, it's best to report them <a href="https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues">here</a> by creating a "New issue" rather than sending an email to the list.
