# Podman Installation Instructions

## Installing on Mac & Windows 

While "containers are Linux," Podman also runs on Mac and Windows, where it
provides a native podman CLI and embeds a guest Linux system to launch your
containers. This guest is referred to as a Podman machine and is managed with
the `podman machine` command. Podman on Mac and Windows also listens for
Docker API clients, supporting direct usage of Docker-based tools and
programmatic access from your language of choice.

### MacOS

On Mac, each Podman machine is backed by a [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) based
virtual machine.  Once installed, the podman command can be run directly from
the Unix shell in `Terminal`, where it remotely communicates with the podman
service running in the Machine VM.

For Mac, Podman is provided through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Once you
have set up brew, you can use the `brew install` command to install Podman:

```bash
brew install podman
```

Next, create and start your first Podman machine:

```bash
podman machine init
podman machine start
```

You can then verify the installation information using:

```bash
podman info
```

More advanced information can be found [here](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/mac_experimental.md).

### Windows

On Windows, each Podman machine is backed by a virtualized Windows System for
Linux (WSLv2) distribution. Once installed, the podman command can be run 
directly from your Windows PowerShell (or CMD) prompt, where it remotely
communicates with the podman service running in the WSL environment.
Alternatively, you can access Podman directly from the WSL instance if you
prefer a Linux prompt and Linux tooling.

See the [Podman for Windows guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/podman-for-windows.md) for setup and usage instructions.

## Installing on Linux

### Linux Distributions

#### [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) & [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org)

```bash
sudo pacman -S podman
```

If you have problems when running Podman in  [rootless](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/README.md#rootless) mode follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Linux_Containers#Enable_support_to_run_unprivileged_containers_(optional))

For more information on Podman on ArchLinux [click here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Podman)


#### [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org)

```bash
sudo apk add podman
```

For further details, please refer to the instructions on the [Alpine Linux wiki](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Podman).

#### [CentOS](https://www.centos.org)

Podman is available in the default Extras repos for CentOS 7 and in
the AppStream repo for CentOS 8 and Stream.

```bash
sudo yum -y install podman
```

#### [Debian](https://debian.org)

The podman package is available in the Debian 11 (Bullseye) repositories and later.

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install podman
```

If you would prefer newer (though not as well-tested) packages including RC
versions, the [Kubic project](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:kubic:libcontainers:unstable/podman)
provides packages for Debian Testing and Unstable.
Checkout the [Kubic project page](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:kubic:libcontainers:unstable/podman)
for a list of supported Debian versions and
architecture combinations. **NOTE:** The command `sudo apt-get -y upgrade`
maybe required in some cases if Podman cannot be installed without it.
The Kubic packages are built using [Fedora's packaging
sources](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/podman/blob/rawhide/f/podman.spec).

CAUTION: The Kubic repo is NOT recommended for production use. Furthermore, we also highly recommend you use Buildah, Podman, and Skopeo ONLY from EITHER the Kubic repo
OR the official Debian repos. Mixing and matching may lead to unpredictable situations including installation conflicts.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings

# Debian Testing/Bookworm
curl -fsSL https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:kubic:libcontainers:unstable/Debian_Testing/Release.key \

# Install Podman
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade
sudo apt-get -y install podman
```

#### [Fedora](https://getfedora.org)

```bash
sudo dnf -y install podman
```

**Podman v4** will [not be
shipped](https://podman.io/blogs/2022/03/06/why_no_podman4_f35.html) officially on Fedora 35.
However, you can still fetch Podman v4 through our [COPR
repo](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/rhcontainerbot/podman4/).

```bash
sudo dnf -y copr enable rhcontainerbot/podman4
sudo dnf -y install podman
```

This COPR repo should not cause any issues while upgrading from Fedora 35 to
Fedora 36. You can simply disable and delete the COPR repo before starting or after completing the upgrade.

```bash
sudo dnf -y copr disable rhcontainerbot/podman4
sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/_copr:copr.fedorainfracloud.org:rhcontainerbot:podman4.repo
```

#### [Fedora-CoreOS](https://coreos.fedoraproject.org), [Fedora SilverBlue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org)

Built-in, no need to install

#### [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org)

```bash
sudo emerge app-containers/podman
```

#### [OpenEmbedded](https://www.openembedded.org)

Bitbake recipes for Podman and its dependencies are available in the
[meta-virtualization layer](https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/meta-virtualization/).
Add the layer to your OpenEmbedded build environment and build Podman using:

```bash
bitbake podman
```

#### [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org)

```bash
sudo zypper install podman
```

#### [openSUSE Kubic](https://kubic.opensuse.org)

Built-in, no need to install

#### [Raspberry Pi OS arm64 (beta)](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/)

Raspberry Pi OS use the standard Debian's repositories,
so it is fully compatible with Debian's arm64 repository.
You can simply follow the [steps for Debian](#debian) to install Podman.


#### [RHEL7](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux)

Subscribe, then enable Extras channel and install Podman.

```bash
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
sudo yum -y install podman
```

#### [RHEL8](https://developers.redhat.com/rhel8)

Podman is included in the `container-tools` module, along with Buildah and Skopeo.

```bash
sudo yum module enable -y container-tools:rhel8
sudo yum module install -y container-tools:rhel8
```

The `container-tools:rhel8` is the fast application stream, containing most recent rolling versions of the tools. Use the `container-tools:2.0` stream for stable versions of Podman 1.6. The command `yum module list container-tools` shows the available streams.

#### [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com)

The podman package is available in the official repositories for Ubuntu 20.10
and newer.

```bash
# Ubuntu 20.10 and newer
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install podman
```

If you would prefer newer (though not as well-tested) packages including RC
versions, the [Kubic project](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:kubic:libcontainers:unstable/podman)
provides packages for the latest Ubuntu versions.
Checkout the [Kubic project page](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:kubic:libcontainers:unstable/podman)
for a list of supported Ubuntu versions and
architecture combinations. **NOTE:** The command `sudo apt-get -y upgrade`
maybe required in some cases if Podman cannot be installed without it.
The Kubic packages are built using [Fedora's packaging
sources](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/podman/blob/rawhide/f/podman.spec).

CAUTION: The Kubic repo is NOT recommended for production use. Furthermore, we highly recommend you use Buildah, Podman, and Skopeo ONLY from EITHER the Kubic repo
OR the official Ubuntu repos. Mixing and matching may lead to unpredictable situations including installation conflicts.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:kubic:libcontainers:unstable/xUbuntu_$(lsb_release -rs)/Release.key \
  | gpg --dearmor \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/devel_kubic_libcontainers_unstable.gpg > /dev/null
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/devel_kubic_libcontainers_unstable.gpg]\
    https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:kubic:libcontainers:unstable/xUbuntu_$(lsb_release -rs)/ /" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:unstable.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update -qq
sudo apt-get -qq -y install podman
```

### Linuxmint

Follow the steps for Ubuntu (or Debian if you use LMDE).

### Installing development versions of Podman

#### [Fedora](https://getfedora.org)

You can test the very latest Podman in Fedora's `updates-testing`
repository before it goes out to all Fedora users.

```console
sudo dnf update --refresh --enablerepo=updates-testing podman
```

If you use a newer Podman package from Fedora's `updates-testing`, we would
appreciate your `+1` feedback in [Bodhi, Fedora's update management
system](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=podman).


### Installing bleeding-edge versions of Podman

If you like danger and are interested in testing the latest
unreleased bits of Podman on Fedora, CentOS and RHEL, we have a [Copr repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/rhcontainerbot/podman-next/).

CAUTION: This repository contains rpm builds generated using the `main` branch
of upstream container tools repositories, and simply CANNOT be recommended for
any production use.

RHEL8 / CentOS 8 Stream users would first need to disable the container-tools
module. All other users can skip this step.

```bash
sudo dnf module disable container-tools -y
```

Enable the Copr and install podman.

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable rhcontainerbot/podman-next -y
sudo dnf install podman
```

## Building from scratch

### Build and Run Dependencies

**Required**

Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, and related distributions you should try to run
`make package-install` which will install dependencies, build the source,
produce rpms for the current platform and install them in the end.

```bash
sudo yum install -y \
  btrfs-progs-devel \
  conmon \
  containernetworking-plugins \
  containers-common \
  crun \
  device-mapper-devel \
  git \
  glib2-devel \
  glibc-devel \
  glibc-static \
  go \
  golang-github-cpuguy83-md2man \
  gpgme-devel \
  iptables \
  libassuan-devel \
  libgpg-error-devel \
  libseccomp-devel \
  libselinux-devel \
  make \
  pkgconfig
```

Debian, Ubuntu, and related distributions:

```bash
sudo apt-get install \
  btrfs-progs \
  crun \
  git \
  golang-go \
  go-md2man \
  iptables \
  libassuan-dev \
  libbtrfs-dev \
  libc6-dev \
  libdevmapper-dev \
  libglib2.0-dev \
  libgpgme-dev \
  libgpg-error-dev \
  libprotobuf-dev \
  libprotobuf-c-dev \
  libseccomp-dev \
  libselinux1-dev \
  libsystemd-dev \
  pkg-config \
  uidmap
```

On openSUSE Leap 15.x and Tumbleweed:

```bash
sudo zypper -n in libseccomp-devel libgpgme-devel
```

On Manjaro (and maybe other Linux distributions):

Make sure that the Linux kernel supports user namespaces:

```
> zgrep CONFIG_USER_NS /proc/config.gz
CONFIG_USER_NS=y

```

If not, please update the kernel.
For Manjaro Linux the instructions can be found here:
https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Manjaro_Kernels

After that enable user namespaces:

```
sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1
```

To enable the user namespaces permanently:

```
echo 'kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1' > /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf
```

### Building missing dependencies

If any dependencies cannot be installed or are not sufficiently current, they have to be built from source.
This will mainly affect Debian, Ubuntu, and related distributions, or RHEL where no subscription is active (e.g. Cloud VMs).

#### golang

Be careful to double-check that the version of golang is new enough (i.e. `go version`), as of January 2022 version is 1.16.x or higher is required.
The current minimum required version can always be found in the [go.mod](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/go.mod) file.
If needed, golang kits are available at https://golang.org/dl/. Alternatively, go can be built from source as follows
(it's helpful to leave the system-go installed, to avoid having to [bootstrap go](https://golang.org/doc/install/source):

```bash
export GOPATH=~/go
git clone https://go.googlesource.com/go $GOPATH
cd $GOPATH
cd src
./all.bash
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
```

#### conmon

The latest version of `conmon` is expected to be installed on the system. Conmon is used to monitor OCI Runtimes.
To build from source, use the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/containers/conmon
cd conmon
export GOCACHE="$(mktemp -d)"
make
sudo make podman
```

#### crun / runc

The latest version of at least one container runtime is expected to be installed on the system. `crun` or `runc` are some of the possibilities, and one is picked up as the default runtime by Podman (crun has priority over runc).
Supported versions of `crun` or `runc` are available for example on Ubuntu 22.04.
`runc` version 1.0.0-rc4 is the minimal requirement, which is available since Ubuntu 18.04.

To double-check, `runc --version` should produce at least `spec: 1.0.1`, otherwise build your own:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opencontainers/runc.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/opencontainers/runc
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/opencontainers/runc
make BUILDTAGS="selinux seccomp"
sudo cp runc /usr/bin/runc
```

#### CNI plugins

#### Setup CNI networking

A proper description of setting up CNI networking is given in the [`cni` README](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/cni/README.md).

A basic setup for CNI networking is done by default during the installation or make processes and
no further configuration is needed to start using Podman.

#### Add configuration

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/containers
sudo curl -L -o /etc/containers/registries.conf https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/containers-common/raw/main/f/registries.conf
sudo curl -L -o /etc/containers/policy.json https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/containers-common/raw/main/f/default-policy.json
```


#### Optional packages

Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, and related distributions:

(no optional packages)

Debian, Ubuntu, and related distributions:

```bash
apt-get install -y \
  libapparmor-dev
```

### Get Source Code

First, ensure that the `go version` that is found first on the $PATH is 1.16.x or higher.  Instruction [above](#golang) will help you compile newer version of Go if needed.  Then we can build Podman:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/containers/podman/
cd podman
make BUILDTAGS="selinux seccomp"
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr
```

#### Build Tags

Otherwise, if you do not want to build Podman with seccomp or selinux support you can add `BUILDTAGS=""` when running make.

```bash
make BUILDTAGS=""
sudo make install
```

Podman supports optional build tags for compiling support of various features.
To add build tags to the make option the `BUILDTAGS` variable must be set, for example:

```bash
make BUILDTAGS='seccomp apparmor'
```

| Build Tag                        | Feature                            | Dependency           |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------|
| apparmor                         | apparmor support                   | libapparmor          |
| exclude_graphdriver_btrfs        | exclude btrfs                      | libbtrfs             |
| exclude_graphdriver_devicemapper | exclude device-mapper              | libdm                |
| libdm_no_deferred_remove         | exclude deferred removal in libdm  | libdm                |
| seccomp                          | syscall filtering                  | libseccomp           |
| selinux                          | selinux process and mount labeling |                      |
| systemd                          | journald logging                   | libsystemd           |

Note that Podman does not officially support device-mapper. Thus, the `exclude_graphdriver_devicemapper` tag is mandatory.

### Vendoring - Dependency Management

This project is using [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for dependency management.  If the CI is complaining about a pull request leaving behind an unclean state, it is very likely right about it.  After changing dependencies, make sure to run `make vendor` to synchronize the code with the go module and repopulate the `./vendor` directory.

#### Ansible

An [Ansible Role](https://github.com/alvistack/ansible-role-podman) is
also available to automate the installation of the above statically
linked binary on its supported OS:

``` bash
sudo su -
mkdir -p ~/.ansible/roles
cd ~/.ansible/roles
git clone https://github.com/alvistack/ansible-role-podman.git podman
cd ~/.ansible/roles/podman
pip3 install --upgrade --ignore-installed --requirement requirements.txt
molecule converge
molecule verify
```

## Configuration files

### [registries.conf](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/containers-common/blob/main/f/registries.conf)

#### Man Page: [registries.conf.5](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md)

`/etc/containers/registries.conf`

registries.conf is the configuration file which specifies which container registries should be consulted when completing image names which do not include a registry or domain portion.

#### Example from the Fedora `containers-common` package

```
$ cat /etc/containers/registries.conf
# For more information on this configuration file, see containers-registries.conf(5).
#
# NOTE: RISK OF USING UNQUALIFIED IMAGE NAMES
# We recommend always using fully qualified image names including the registry
# server (full dns name), namespace, image name, and tag
# (e.g., registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi:latest). Pulling by digest (i.e.,
# quay.io/repository/name@digest) further eliminates the ambiguity of tags.
# When using short names, there is always an inherent risk that the image being
# pulled could be spoofed. For example, a user wants to pull an image named
# `foobar` from a registry and expects it to come from myregistry.com. If
# myregistry.com is not first in the search list, an attacker could place a
# different `foobar` image at a registry earlier in the search list. The user
# would accidentally pull and run the attacker's image and code rather than the
# intended content. We recommend only adding registries which are completely
# trusted (i.e., registries which don't allow unknown or anonymous users to
# create accounts with arbitrary names). This will prevent an image from being
# spoofed, squatted or otherwise made insecure.  If it is necessary to use one
# of these registries, it should be added at the end of the list.
#
# # An array of host[:port] registries to try when pulling an unqualified image, in order.
unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.fedoraproject.org", "registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"]
#
# [[registry]]
# # The "prefix" field is used to choose the relevant [[registry]] TOML table;
# # (only) the TOML table with the longest match for the input image name
# # (taking into account namespace/repo/tag/digest separators) is used.
# #
# # If the prefix field is missing, it defaults to be the same as the "location" field.
# prefix = "example.com/foo"
#
# # If true, unencrypted HTTP as well as TLS connections with untrusted
# # certificates are allowed.
# insecure = false
#
# # If true, pulling images with matching names is forbidden.
# blocked = false
#
# # The physical location of the "prefix"-rooted namespace.
# #
# # By default, this equal to "prefix" (in which case "prefix" can be omitted
# # and the [[registry]] TOML table can only specify "location").
# #
# # Example: Given
# #   prefix = "example.com/foo"
# #   location = "internal-registry-for-example.net/bar"
# # requests for the image example.com/foo/myimage:latest will actually work with the
# # internal-registry-for-example.net/bar/myimage:latest image.
# location = "internal-registry-for-example.com/bar"
#
# # (Possibly-partial) mirrors for the "prefix"-rooted namespace.
# #
# # The mirrors are attempted in the specified order; the first one that can be
# # contacted and contains the image will be used (and if none of the mirrors contains the image,
# # the primary location specified by the "registry.location" field, or using the unmodified
# # user-specified reference, is tried last).
# #
# # Each TOML table in the "mirror" array can contain the following fields, with the same semantics
# # as if specified in the [[registry]] TOML table directly:
# # - location
# # - insecure
# [[registry.mirror]]
# location = "example-mirror-0.local/mirror-for-foo"
# [[registry.mirror]]
# location = "example-mirror-1.local/mirrors/foo"
# insecure = true
# # Given the above, a pull of example.com/foo/image:latest will try:
# # 1. example-mirror-0.local/mirror-for-foo/image:latest
# # 2. example-mirror-1.local/mirrors/foo/image:latest
# # 3. internal-registry-for-example.net/bar/image:latest
# # in order, and use the first one that exists.
#
# short-name-mode="enforcing"

[[registry]]
location="localhost:5000"
insecure=true
```

### [mounts.conf](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/containers-common/blob/main/f/mounts.conf)

`/usr/share/containers/mounts.conf` and optionally `/etc/containers/mounts.conf`

The mounts.conf files specify volume mount directories that are automatically mounted inside containers when executing the `podman run` or `podman build` commands.  Container process can then use this content.  The volume mount content does not get committed to the final image.

Usually these directories are used for passing secrets or credentials required by the package software to access remote package repositories.

For example, a mounts.conf with the line "`/usr/share/rhel/secrets:/run/secrets`", the content of `/usr/share/rhel/secrets` directory is mounted on `/run/secrets` inside the container.  This mountpoint allows Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions from the host to be used within the container.

Note this is not a volume mount. The content of the volumes is copied into container storage, not bind mounted directly from the host.

#### Example from the Fedora `containers-common` package:

```
cat /usr/share/containers/mounts.conf
/usr/share/rhel/secrets:/run/secrets
```

### [seccomp.json](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/containers-common/blob/main/f/seccomp.json)

`/usr/share/containers/seccomp.json`

seccomp.json contains the whitelist of seccomp rules to be allowed inside of
containers.  This file is usually provided by the containers-common package.

The link above takes you to the seccomp.json

### [policy.json](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/containers-common/blob/main/f/default-policy.json)

`/etc/containers/policy.json`

#### Man Page: [policy.json.5](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-policy.json.5.md)


#### Example from the Fedora `containers-common` package:

```
cat /etc/containers/policy.json
{
    "default": [
        {
            "type": "insecureAcceptAnything"
        }
    ],
    "transports":
        {
            "docker-daemon":
                {
                    "": [{"type":"insecureAcceptAnything"}]
                }
        }
}
```
