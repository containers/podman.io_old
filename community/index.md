We want your feedback, issues, patches, and involvement in the development of Podman. See Contributing for how to submit issues & PRs, and chat with us on Slack, IRC, or Email.

## Slack and IRC

The Podman developers often hang out on the #CRI-O channel in [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/). Note that the devs are generally around during CEST and Eastern Time business hours, so be patient if you're in another time zone. There's also Podman users and developers on [IRC.Freenode.Net](https://webchat.freenode.net/) channel #podman.

## Mailing List

A mailing list is now available for your questions, concerns or comments about Podman. There are two methods that can be used to subscribe to it.

1.  Send an email to [podman-join@lists.podman.io](mailto: podman-join@lists.podman.io?subject=subscribe) with the word "Subscribe" in the subject.
2.  Go to this [page](https://lists.podman.io/admin/lists/podman.lists.podman.io/) on the lists.podman.io site, scroll down to the bottom of the page and enter your email and optionally name, then click on the "Subscribe" buton.

Regardless of which method you use, a confirmation email will be sent to you. After you reply back to that confirmation email, you'll then be able to send mail directly to [podman@lists.podman.io](mailto: podman@lists.podman.io). You can then also go to the list's [web page](https://lists.podman.io/archives/list/podman@lists.podman.io/) and from there you can see all of the past conversations on the list or manage your subscription.  
Please note, if you have a bug that you'd like to report, it's best to report them [here](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues) by creating a "New issue" rather than sending an email to the list.
