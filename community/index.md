We want your feedback, issues, patches, and involvement in the development of Podman. See Contributing for how to submit issues & PRs, and chat with us on Slack, IRC, or Email.

## Slack, IRC, Matrix and Discord

The Podman developers often hang out on the #CRIO channel in [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/). Note that the devs are generally around during CEST and Eastern Time business hours, so be patient if you're in another time zone. There's also Podman users and developers on IRC on the `#podman` channel on `libera.chat` as well as [#podman:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#podman:fedoraproject.org) on `matrix` and on the [Podman Discord](https://discord.gg/x5GzFF6QH4). The `matrix` room has been bridged with the `Discord` server and `libera.chat` channel so joining either one should be sufficient.

Click [here](./irc.md) for more information on the #podman IRC channel.

## Community Meetings

Community meetings are held on the first Tuesday of even numbered months, generally at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.  This meeting is used to show demos for or to have general discussions about Podman or other related container technologies.  It is also used to make announcements about Podman and the other projects in the [Containers repository](https://github.com/containers/) on GitHub.

Podman Community Cabal meetings are held on the third Thursday of the month at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.  The focus of the cabal meeting is the planning and discussion of possible future changes to Podman or the related Containers projects and discussing any outstanding issues that might need solving.

Many of the maintainers for the Podman project attend both of these meetings, so it's a great chance for the community to ask them questions or address concerns directly.  If you have a topic that you'd like to propose for either meeting, please send a note to the Mailing List.

For more information, including links to the Agenda, Video Conference Room, and more, see the [Community Meeting](https://podman.io/community/meeting/) page.  All are welcome to attend either meeting, and there is no cost other than your time.

## Mailing List

A mailing list is now available for your questions, concerns or comments about Podman. There are two methods that can be used to subscribe to it.

1.  Send an email to [podman-join@lists.podman.io](mailto: podman-join@lists.podman.io?subject=subscribe) with the word "Subscribe" in the subject.
2.  Go to this [page](https://lists.podman.io/admin/lists/podman.lists.podman.io/) on the lists.podman.io site, scroll down to the bottom of the page and enter your email and optionally name, then click on the "Subscribe" button.

Regardless of which method you use, a confirmation email will be sent to you. After you reply back to that confirmation email, you'll then be able to send mail directly to [podman@lists.podman.io](mailto: podman@lists.podman.io). You can then also go to the list's [web page](https://lists.podman.io/archives/list/podman@lists.podman.io/) and from there you can see all of the past conversations on the list or manage your subscription.  
Please note, if you have a bug that you'd like to report, it's best to report them [here](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues) by creating a "New issue" rather than sending an email to the list.
