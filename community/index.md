We want your feedback, issues, patches, and involvement in the development of Podman. See Contributing for how to submit issues & PRs, and chat with us on Slack, IRC, or Email.

## Slack and IRC

The Podman developers often hang out on the #CRI-O channel in [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/). Note that the devs are generally around during CEST and Eastern Time business hours, so be patient if you're in another time zone. There's also Podman users and developers on IRC on the `#podman` channel on `libera.chat`.

## Community Meetings

Community meetings are held on the first Tuesday of the month, generally at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.  The meetings are held using using BlueJeans
video conferencing and all are welcome.  There is no cost other than your time.  For more information, see the [Community Meeting](https://podman.io/community/meeting/) page.

## Mailing List

A mailing list is now available for your questions, concerns or comments about Podman. There are two methods that can be used to subscribe to it.

1.  Send an email to [podman-join@lists.podman.io](mailto: podman-join@lists.podman.io?subject=subscribe) with the word "Subscribe" in the subject.
2.  Go to this [page](https://lists.podman.io/admin/lists/podman.lists.podman.io/) on the lists.podman.io site, scroll down to the bottom of the page and enter your email and optionally name, then click on the "Subscribe" button.

Regardless of which method you use, a confirmation email will be sent to you. After you reply back to that confirmation email, you'll then be able to send mail directly to [podman@lists.podman.io](mailto: podman@lists.podman.io). You can then also go to the list's [web page](https://lists.podman.io/archives/list/podman@lists.podman.io/) and from there you can see all of the past conversations on the list or manage your subscription.  
Please note, if you have a bug that you'd like to report, it's best to report them [here](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues) by creating a "New issue" rather than sending an email to the list.
