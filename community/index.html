We want your feedback, issues, patches, and involvement in the development of Podman.  See Contributing for how to submit issues & PRs, and chat with us on Slack, IRC, or Email.

<h2>Slack and IRC</h2>

The Podman developers often hang out on the #CRI-O channel in [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/).  Note that the devs are generally around during CEST and Eastern Time business hours, so be patient if you're in another time zone.

There's also Podman users and developers on [IRC.Freenode.Net](https://webchat.freenode.net/) channel #podman.

<h2>Mailing List</h2>

A mailing list is now available for your questions, concerns or comments about Podman.  There are two methods that can be used
to subscribe to it.

<ol>
  <li>Send an email to <a href="mailto: podman-join@lists.podman.io?subject=subscribe">podman-join@lists.podman.io</a> with the word "Subscribe" in the subject.</li>
  <li>Go to this <a href="https://lists.podman.io/admin/lists/podman.lists.podman.io/">page</a> on the lists.podman.io site, scroll down to the bottom of the page and enter your email and optionally name, then click on the "Subscribe" buton.</li>
</ol>

Regardless of which method you use, a confirmation email will be sent to you.  After you reply back to that confirmation email, you'll then be able to send mail directly to <a href="mailto: podman@lists.podman.io">podman@lists.podman.io</a>.  You can then also go to the list's <a href="https://lists.podman.io/archives/list/podman@lists.podman.io/">web page</a> and from there you can see all of the past conversations on the list or manage your subscription.
<br>
Please note, if you have a bug that you'd like to report, it's best to report them <a href="https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues">here</a> by creating a "New issue" rather than sending an email to the list.
