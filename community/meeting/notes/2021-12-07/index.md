Dumping the network stack for a new one in Podman 4.0, one that we will own and control.  Netavark is mostly working for IPv4 and a firewall driver is close to being completed.

Podman with netavark GitHub repo: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/rhcontainerbot/podman-next/

Looking to replece DNS Server within Podman too with this change.  The goal is to have a container with as many networks as you'd want.  Testers are very welcomed.  Bug reports to the netavark for network issues, against Podman in it's GitHub if more Podman related.


## Podman on Windows Demo
### Jason Greene via Tom Sweeney
#### (10:12 in the video)

(We had trouble with the video sharing, Tom Sweeney narrated badly...)

Jason's first video showed how to run Podman on a Windows machine using WSL.  It basically has the same look, feel as the macOS variant does.  Jason talked about the architecutre under the covers and things he wants to improve upon.  The direct [Video](https://youtu.be/KIGeWpd91Z0) can be found on YouTube along with Jason's Update [Video](https://youtu.be/ub2m15yW-fg) which was not shown in the meeting.  The update shows his progress and how Podman can be installed on a Windows machine that doesn't have WSL.

The quality is much better there than in the meetings recording.

## Meeting Announcement

Going to hold this meeting every other month on the first Tuesday of the month starting in Feburary (even numbered months).  The Cabal meeting will remain a monthly meeting on the third Thursday of each month.

## Open Forum/Questions?
#### (26:00) in the video) 

1) Podman on Fedora32 on Windows doesn't go easy.
    Matt thinks this is a systemd issue and more invesigation is needed.

2) Ionut Stoica is working on a project to add tools for front end work.  https://iongion.github.io/podman-desktop-companion/ It's kind of Cockpit like.  Hopes to add more in the future.  Looking at Windows and mac, but needs to work on compilation issues.  Easier on the Mac, but needs to use Lima.  Will check in with Jason Greene
