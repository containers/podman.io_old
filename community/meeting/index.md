Community meetings are held on the first Tuesday of each month.  They are scheduled for one hour in 
duration, and generally start at 11:00 a.m. Eastern.  The start time may change occassionally to make
the meeting more convenient for the Podman community members from India, China, Australia and other countries
in those time zones.

The meetings will be held using a BlueJeans video conference room.  That room is located [here](https://bluejeans.com/796412039)
and there is no charge to attend.

While the meeting is ongoing, the meeting notes will be compiled using [HackMD](https://hackmd.io) on this [page](https://hackmd.io/fc1zraYdS0-klJ2KJcfC7w)
and later saved to this site with a link added [below](https://podman.io/community/meeting/#notes-from-the-community-meetings).

The agenda for the upcoming meeting will be sent at least two weeks prior to the [podman@lists.podman.io](mailto:podman@lists.podman.io) email list and it will 
be posted [below](https://podman.io/community/meeting/#next-podman-community-meeting-agenda)

## Next Podman Community Meeting Agenda

Topics for the next or any other future meeting will be gratefully accepted.  Please send
a topic request to the [podman@lists.podman.io](mailto:podman@lists.podman.io) email list

discuss or present would be helpful.  If we can't squeeze you into the next meeting,
