## Podman Community Cabal meeting
### Next Meeting: Thursday March 17, 2022 11:00 a.m. EDT (UTC-4)

The Podman Community Cabal meetings will happen on the third Thursday of each month, starting at 11:00 a.m. Eastern.
The "Cabal" meeting is used to discuss any design question, issue, or other related topics with the maintainers of
the Podman project.  We will also try to leave at least the last 20 minutes of the hour long meeting as an "Open Forum".
There is no charge to attend this meeting.

If you have a topic that you know about in advance for an upcoming Cabal meeting, please send a note to the
[Podman Mailing List](https://podman.io/community/#mailing-list) or add a topic to the [discussion](https://github.com/containers/podman/discussions/10670) on GitHub.
