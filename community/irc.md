# {{ page.title }}

The Podman and many other container projects have recently moved to Libera.Chat for IRC communications.  The #podman channel on the freenode network is no longer being used by Podman developers.

If you are a current IRC user, please go and register your nick(s) on
Libera.Chat ( https://libera.chat/guides/registration#registering ) and
rejoin the #podman channel. You can take this opportunity
to choose a new secure password and make sure you are connecting via SSL. There is good
documentation about choosing an IRC client at https://libera.chat/guides/clients
