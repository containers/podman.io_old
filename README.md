## Website Contributors

The website runs on GitHub Pages via Jekyll to make it as convenient as possible for you to contribute. You can add blog posts by adding a file to the `_posts` folder. The file must use the following naming convention: `yyyy-mm-dd-relevant-title-here.md`.

In the file itself, you will need to start with the following metadata:

```
---
title: <your title here>
layout: default
author: <your (nick)name here>
categories: [blogs]
tags: <your tags here>
---

<yourtext in markdown format goes here, check out other blog posts if you're unsure how to proceed>
```

Please pay attention to the `categories: [blogs]` section. Currently, there are 3 categories available: `[blogs]`, `[releases]`, and `[new]`.
