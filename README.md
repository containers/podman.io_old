## Website Contributors

The website runs on GitHub Pages via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to make it as convenient as possible for you to contribute. 

Before you start, please verify that you've an entry for yourself in the top level _config.yml file in the 
`authors` section.  Your entry should look like the following example.  Please note if you do not have a gravatar, a twitter account or simply don't want to share a particular field, just leave the field blank or completely remove the particular line.

```
  jsmith:
    name: Jessica Smith
    display_name: Jessica Smith
    gravatar: c69c8419c8e4d1bbedc7874281453781
    email: jsmith@mycompany.com
    web: https://mywebsite.com
    twitter: JSmithOnTwitter
    github: JSmithOnGitHub
```

You can add blog posts by adding a file to the `_posts` folder. The file must use the following naming convention: `yyyy-mm-dd-relevant-title-here.md`.  In the file itself, you will need to start with the following metadata:


```
---
title: <your title here>
layout: default
author: <author id, from the example above 'jsmith'>
categories: [blogs]
tags: <your tags here>
---

{% assign author = site.authors[page.author] %}
# My Blog Title
## By {{ author.display_name }} [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ author.github }}) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ author.twitter }})

<yourtext in markdown format goes here, check out other blog posts if you're unsure how to proceed>
```

Please pay attention to the **`categories: [blogs]`** section. Currently, there are 4 categories available: `[blogs]`, `[releases]`, `[talks]` and `[new]`.

**NOTE:** If you want to add a ':' (colon) to your title, you will need to instead use `&#58;`, otherwise the post will not be displayed on the index page.  For example:

```
Instead of:

title: My first blog post: Can you believe it?

use:

title: My first blog post&#58; Can you believe it?
```

Finally if your blog is more than a paragraph or two long, please add this tag after the first or second paragraph:

```
<!--readmore-->
```
This will provide a preview on the blogs index page and the reader can read that first bit and then decide if they want to go in for a deeper dive.

### Testing locally

#### Configuration steps:

```
dnf install ruby ruby-devel g++
gem install jekyll bundler
gem install github-pages
```
#### VM network setup
If you are running on a VM, you may need to open up port 4000 on your firewall

```
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=4000/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
```
#### Making changes
First `cd` into your podman.io directory after having done a `git clone` of this project.  Change or add the files that yow want to.

You can now test your changes locally, especially useful if you are making look/feel changes, by first running `bundle install` and then start the server by doing: `bundle exec jekyll s`.  If you make follow up changes, you can use the `bundle exec jekyll build` in place of the `bundle install` command.

Then browse to http://127.0.0.1:4000 to view your changes.

If you run this on a VM, then use this command: 
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --host 192.###.###.###   - IP Address of VM
```

And then you can attach to the server using your web brower, `http://{IP.address}:4000`.  Note, you must use `http` and not `https`.
